## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction

The Micro Focus Bankdemo application is a simplified mainframe "green screen" banking application which runs under Micro Focus 
Enterprise Server. This project provides demonstrations and tutorials of various ways you can configure or modify the application
to suit differing requirements which could then be used as a template for running and configuring your own application.

The project demonstrates a selection of the capabilities of Micro Focus Enterprise Server and these options will be extended over time. 
It demonstrates applications running on-premise and also includes introductory tutorials for the use of
the Micro Focus Enterprise Developer for Eclipse and Visual Studio integrated development environments.

In the simplest configuration, it demonstrates a CICS/JCL COBOL application that accesses banking data held in indexed (VSAM) files on disk. However, it can also be configured to access data from a PostgreSQL database and database hosted VSAM files using the Micro Focus Database File Handler (or MFDBFH for short). Micro Focus will be adding further demonstrations in the future to show more complex deployments such as those involving scale-out and cloud deployments.
